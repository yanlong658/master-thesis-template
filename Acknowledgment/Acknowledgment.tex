I would like to thank the following people, without whom I would not have been able to complete this research, and without whom I would not have made it through my master's degree!
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The NCRL Lab. at National Chiao Tung University, especially to my advisor Dr. Teng-Hu Cheng., whose insight and knowledge into the subject matter steered me through this research.
  \item My roommates and friends, who have supported me and given me useful advice, and had to put up with my stresses for the past two years of study!
  \item And my biggest thanks to my family for all the support you have shown me in two years of learning.
\end{enumerate}
